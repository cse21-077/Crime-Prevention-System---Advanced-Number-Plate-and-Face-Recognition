# Crime-Prevention-System---Advanced-Number-Plate-and-Face-Recognition
By  Using already deployed cameras across the city, the system aims to enhance the identification and apprehension of criminals. It is important to note that this project is currently in its early stages, with ongoing development and refinement anticipated

This repository contains an advanced Python script for integrated number plate recognition, identification, and face recognition. The system is designed to detect number plates in images, identify the car details associated with the number plate, and perform face recognition with a focus on recognizing individuals even when wearing glasses.

## Features

1. **Number Plate Recognition:**
   - Utilizes the YOLOv3 deep learning model for accurate license plate detection.
   - Extracts the license plate region and displays it for further processing.
   - Calls a function to identify and verify the number plate against a hypothetical database.

2. **Face Recognition:**
   - Employs the dlib library for face detection and facial landmark prediction.
   - Draws bounding boxes around detected faces and overlays facial landmarks for visualization.
   - Calls a function to identify and verify the face against a hypothetical database.

3. **Database Interaction:**
   - Placeholder functions (`identify_number_plate` and `identify_face`) simulate the process of identifying and verifying information against a database.
   - These functions can be extended with your own logic for a real-world application.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- dlib
- YOLOv3 weights and configuration file for license plate detection (not provided in this repository)

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy dlib
   
## Setup:

Download YOLOv3 weights and configuration file for license plate detection. Place them in the project directory.
Execution:

python main_script.py pitures/image67.jpg
Replace /image.jpg with the image path for processing.
